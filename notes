after ft_printf is called. need to check error handling and validation before
trying to solve the string and parse it. 
after validation check and error, parse the string and store the data for each
portion of the parameter together in a doubly linked list. this should allow
for quick manipulation and processing.

free request;
free(node);
free(param);
free(arr);


the system printf if passed a flag it doesn't recognize ignores it if coupled
with another flag it does recognize, it completes the flag it recognizes.

even if the the flag it doesnt recognize is in the middle.

i was just making sure that it was handled by the compiler

if i put the variadic arguments in an array/list then i can call/validate the
order and make sure that the parameter format match the list.

// for keeping track of the number of parameters passed from the main.
have to make sure that the *format string is counted for the number of
parameters passed. 
count the letters after the % sign and then count the number of va_arg calls

ok so if you copy the input to an array then when checking the parameters
passed you can put the parameter to its format identifier.
